## üîß Configure MCP Server

### 1. Add MCP Server in Cursor Settings

Open Cursor settings (`Cmd/Ctrl + ,`), find the MCP configuration section, and add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "awesome-mcp-scaffold": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "server.main"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/your/Awesome-MCP-Scaffold",
      "env": {
        "TRANSPORT": "stdio",
        "ENVIRONMENT": "development",
        "DEBUG": "true"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Verify Connection

In Cursor, press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`, search for "MCP", you should see:
- **MCP: Connect to Server**
- **MCP: List Tools**
- **MCP: List Resources**
